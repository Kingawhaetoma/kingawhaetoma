# 👋 Hi, I'm King Awhaetoma

🎓 Cybersecurity Student  
🔐 Future SOC Analyst  
🚀 Builder | Developer | Learner  

---
Cybersecurity student and developer focused on building practical security tools and real-world applications. My work combines security analysis, backend logic, and mobile development.

I built a Python SOC Log Analyzer that detects brute-force attacks using time-window analysis, severity scoring, and automated reporting with GeoIP enrichment — simulating real SOC workflows.

I am also developing a mobile small-group application using React Native and Supabase, implementing authentication, backend integration, and scalable user management.

Previously, I created a 2D arcade game in Python using Pygame, demonstrating object-oriented programming, event handling, and game logic design.

My interests include:
• Security monitoring and threat detection
• Python automation and tool development
• Mobile app development
• Backend systems and authentication

Currently preparing for a career as a SOC Analyst / Security Engineer, while continuing to build tools and applications that strengthen my technical depth.
