# 👋 Hi, I'm King Awhaetoma

🎓 Cybersecurity Student  
🔐 Future SOC Analyst  
🚀 Builder | Developer | Learner  

---
Cybersecurity student and developer focused on building practical security tools and real-world applications. My work combines security analysis, backend logic, and mobile development.

I created a Python SOC Log Analyzer that detects brute-force attacks using time-based analysis, severity scoring, and GeoIP enrichment — simulating real SOC workflows.

Currently developing a mobile small-group app using React Native and Supabase, implementing authentication, backend integration, and scalable user management.

Previously built a 2D arcade game in Python, demonstrating object-oriented programming and application logic.

Focus Areas
• Security monitoring and threat detection
• Python automation and tool development
• Mobile and backend application development

Preparing for a career as a SOC Analyst / Security Engineer while continuing to build practical security-focused projects.
